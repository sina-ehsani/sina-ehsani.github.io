    <h3 id="bio">Bio</h3>
    <p class="biotext"> I grow up in Isfahan, Iran, and started my engineering career at the Isfahan University of Technology, getting a bachelor of science in Industria Engineering. I moved to the US for higher education and was able to get my master's in Systems Engineering and in Computer Science from the University of Arizona. Currently, I am finishing up my Ph.D. in Systems and Industrial Engineering. My research topic is related to the Natural Language Processing field, mainly the Question Answering problem.
    In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, practicing drums, and traveling to different parts of the world.

  		Each participant was asked to go to visit each website and report their experience on the questionnaire, including 27 questions. The answers for these questions were then processed and summarized into four categories: Intended to use, ease of learning, utility, products and service, and impression of website useability. The summery of participants responds are shown in <a href="#responses">Table 3</a>.

  	<p> <a href="#chart">Chart 1</a> summarizes the mean score for each website. As you can see YankeeCandle.com was able to achieve better results on "ease of learning", "utility", and "impressions of website useability". Both websites performed similarly in the "intend to use" and "products and service" categories. This shows on average YankeeCandle.com performed better than GooseCreeckCandle.com.
  	The standard deviation for all categories except "ease of learning" for GooseCreeckCandle.com were higher than YankeeCandle.com meaning users opinion varied more when using YankeeCandle.com </p>

  	<img src="chart2.png" id="chart" class='chart'>

  	<p> Overall, based on this study on four participants, <a href="https://www.yankeecandle.com" target="_blank">YankeeCandle.com</a>  is the clear winner. </p>

  <div class="learned">
  	<h2 id="learned" >What I Learned</h2>
  	<p> Based on the usability research I conducted, now I know where to shop for candles if I ever needed it. In addition to this great finding, I learned more about performing user usability research and most importantly how to represent the data to the public. Learning to show data in tables and charts with clear formats and minimal data so people can take away the idea within a glance. <br>
  	Also, I learned designing a website using HTML and CSS. This was a great exercise helping me to learn more about website design and using in a real research study. </p>
