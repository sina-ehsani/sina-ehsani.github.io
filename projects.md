### Agentic AI Routing System for Industrial Processes

As the lead on this project at Armada, I architected a scalable agentic AI routing system designed for complex industrial applications. The system leverages advanced ML and optimization to translate complex data into actionable, natural-language insights for operators.

*   **Key Technologies:** Generative AI, LLMs, Reinforcement Learning (GRPO), Self-correction Mechanisms, Python.
*   **Impact & Achievements:**
    *   The distilled models **outperform large-scale proprietary systems by over 10%**.
    *   The system is optimized for edge deployment, ensuring high performance in real-world industrial environments.
    *   Improved overall efficiency of complex industrial processes by a **projected 4.5%**.

### Deep Neural Network for Flight-Level Traffic Forecasting

At American Airlines, I led the development of a deep neural network forecasting engine to predict flight-level traffic for the Yield Management team. This involved using a multimodal approach to capture complex trends and seasonality.

*   **Key Technologies:** Deep Learning, Multimodal Neural Networks, Time-Series Analysis, Python, PyTorch, AzureML.
*   **Impact & Achievements:**
    *   **Reduced prediction mean square errors by 50%** compared to previous models.
    *   Successfully deployed for A/B testing and potential replacement of legacy systems.
    *   Expanded to cover over 7,000 flights, providing accurate predictions for the next 330 days.

### Multimodal Deep Learning for Robotic Control & QA

This work, stemming from my doctoral research and applied at Armada, focuses on integrating language and vision to create more intelligent systems.

*   **Key Technologies:** Multimodal Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, NLP, Computer Vision (CNNs), Python, PyTorch.
*   **Impact & Achievements:**
    *   Pioneered OPUS, an LLM framework to control robotic camera systems with natural language, achieving **20% higher task accuracy** than large proprietary models.
    *   Developed a novel multimodal architecture that **reduces mean squared error by 10-15%** across diverse tasks.
    *   Introduced a Textual Question Answering architecture that employs on-demand visual grounding, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4 with a 400M parameter model.

### Ontology Alignment and Clinical Data Processing

While at Truveta, I contributed to the mission of "Saving Lives with Data" by developing data-driven NLP approaches for clinical text.

*   **Key Technologies:** Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP, Ontology Alignment, Python.
*   **Impact & Achievements:**
    *   Pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs on clinical data, significantly increasing downstream training and inference speeds (**fourfold and twofold**, respectively).
    *   Achieved state-of-the-art results in ontology alignment, with a **5% improvement in F1, Hit@1, and MRR**.
    *   Developed Truveta Mapper, a novel framework for unsupervised ontology alignment.
