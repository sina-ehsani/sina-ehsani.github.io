Hello! I'm Sina, an AI engineer and researcher driven by a fascination with how machines can learn to perceive and interact with the world in complex, human-like ways. My work is focused on turning cutting-edge research into practical, real-world applications that solve meaningful problems.

My journey began in academia, where my Ph.D. research explored the intersection of vision and language. I developed novel deep learning models that could not only answer complex questions by analyzing text and images but also control robotic systems using natural language, improving task accuracy by over 20%.

I've since carried that passion into the industry. At American Airlines, I led the creation of a forecasting engine that cut flight traffic prediction errors in half. Later, at Truveta, I had the opportunity to contribute to the mission of "Saving Lives with Data" by building NLP models that processed sensitive clinical data, significantly accelerating research workflows.

Currently, as a **Lead AI Engineer at Armada**, I am building the next generation of intelligent industrial systems. I lead the development of a sophisticated agentic AI platform that delivers real-time, natural-language insights to operators on the ground. Our system, optimized for edge deployment, already outperforms larger proprietary models by over 10% and is on track to boost industrial efficiency by 4.5%.

I believe in building AI that is not only powerful but also collaborative and accessible. I'm a strong advocate for open-source and am always excited by the challenge of creating robust, scalable solutions that empower people and drive innovation.
