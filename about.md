<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	At the University of Arizona, I am completing my Ph.D. My main research interest in recent years has been deep learning, specifically Natural Language Processing. I appreciate creating Neural Network methods that can be used to solve intriguing AI problems. I'm currently working on textual question answering task utilizing a multimodel (transformers and vision networks).
