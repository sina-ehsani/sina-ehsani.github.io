### My Expertise

My work spans several key areas of artificial intelligence:

*   **Deep Learning & NLP:** I have extensive experience in designing and deploying deep neural networks. At American Airlines, I developed a forecasting engine that reduced prediction errors by 50%. I've also pre-trained and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) on clinical text data at Truveta, significantly improving downstream task accuracy.
*   **Agentic AI & Reinforcement Learning:** I architected a scalable agentic AI routing system that outperformed large proprietary systems by over 10%. I also developed a novel multimodal deep learning architecture using reinforcement learning, reducing mean squared error by 10-15% compared to state-of-the-art models.
*   **Multimodal Learning:** My doctoral research focused on combining vision and language data. I've developed systems that leverage both text and images to enhance machine question answering and pioneered a framework to control robotic camera systems using natural language, improving task accuracy by 20%.

### My Philosophy

I believe in the power of AI to drive progress and I am an active contributor to open-source and collaborative AI initiatives. Whether it's developing prescriptive intelligence platforms to improve industrial efficiency or analyzing geospatial data to predict network performance, my goal is to translate complex data into actionable, natural-language insights that empower operators and analysts. I am driven by the challenge of solving impactful problems and turning innovative research into robust, production-ready systems.
