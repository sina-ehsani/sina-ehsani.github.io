<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	I am finishing up my Ph.D. at the University of Arizona. Working on deep learning particularly Natural Language Processing has been my main research interest in the past years. I genuinely enjoy developing Neural Network algorithms that can be employed in interesting AI challenges. Currently, I am working on using a multimodel (i.e., transformers and vision networks) on textual question answering tasks.
