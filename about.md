	I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Arizona, with a focus on multimodal deep learning, particularly the combination of natural language processing and vision. My passion is in developing Neural Network methods to solve complex AI problems, and I am currently working on a multimodal network that integrates multimedia information to capture spatial and sequential dependencies. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I am excited to continue exploring new ways to apply these technologies to real-world problems.
