Hello, welcome to my website! My name is **Sina Ehsani**. I am a Ph.D. graduate from the University of Arizona, specialized in multimodal deep learning, specifically integrating natural language processing and vision. My academic pursuit has been deeply rooted in the development of Neural Network methods to solve intricate AI problems, with a recent success in constructing a multimodal network that adeptly amalgamates multimedia information to capture spatial and sequential dependencies.

Thriving at the confluence of machine learning and artificial intelligence, I have developed a keen interest in Large Language Models (LLMs). I am truly captivated by their potential to transform the field of Natural Language Processing and beyond, and have already had the chance to leverage their power during my postdoctoral research at Truveta, where we were able to achieve significant advancements in processing clinical text data.

Moreover, I find the domain of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback incredibly intriguing. The intricate blend of artificial intelligence with human-like decision-making processes, and the potential it holds for optimizing model behaviors is a challenge I look forward to exploring.

One of the most rewarding aspects of my work is the ability to apply AI for good. I am proud to have contributed to the mission of saving lives with data at Truveta and the work I've done in at at American Airlines, where I developed a deep learning forecasting engine. This innovation has not only improved the accuracy of our forecasts but also significantly streamlined the workflow of our analysts. By automating the routine tasks that were previously performed manually, we've enabled our analysts to redirect their valuable time and creativity towards solving more complex and intellectually stimulating problems. This transition, I believe, epitomizes the true potential of AI â€“ to automate the mundane and inspire the extraordinary.

The journey I've embarked upon in the vast field of AI has been filled with numerous explorations, intriguing challenges, and enriching accomplishments. I am excited to continue my pursuit, pushing the boundaries of AI technology to solve real-world problems and make a significant difference in people's lives.
